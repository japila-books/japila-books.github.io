# "The Internals Of" Online Books

The project is the web site of the ["The Internals Of" Online Books](https://github.com/japila-books) organization with the online books of the following open source projects:

* [Apache Spark](https://books.japila.pl/apache-spark-internals)
* [Delta Lake](https://books.japila.pl/delta-lake-internals)
* [Apache Beam](https://books.japila.pl/apache-beam-internals)

The aim of this project is to host all the current and future internals books under a single organization on GitHub and publish to a single domain via GitHub Pages (_until I find a better way to publish the books_).
