# "The Internals Of" Online Books

Welcome to ["The Internals Of" Online Books](https://github.com/japila-books) project! Happy to have you here.

I'm [Jacek Laskowski](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/jaceklaskowski), an IT freelancer specializing in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) (with brief forays into a wider data engineering space, e.g. [Trino](https://trino.io/) and [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/), mostly during [Warsaw Data Engineering](https://www.meetup.com/Warsaw-Data-Engineering/) meetups).

I'm very excited to have you here and hope you will enjoy exploring the internals of the following open source projects together:

* [Apache Spark](https://books.japila.pl/apache-spark-internals)
* [Spark SQL](https://jaceklaskowski.github.io/mastering-spark-sql-book/)
* [Spark Structured Streaming](https://jaceklaskowski.github.io/spark-structured-streaming-book/)
* [Delta Lake](https://books.japila.pl/delta-lake-internals)
* [Apache Kafka](https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/apache-kafka/content/)
* [Kafka Streams](https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-kafka-streams/content/)
* [Apache Beam](https://books.japila.pl/apache-beam-internals)

Please note that some books have less current content than others, but that's expected with a one-person project where some many things are so interesting and thus time-consuming. Life's too short to taste everything :/

The aim of this project is to host all the current and future internals books under a single organization on GitHub and publish to a single domain via GitHub Pages (_until I find a better way to publish the books_).
